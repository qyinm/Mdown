# Privacy Policy

**Last updated:** January 31, 2025

## Overview

Mdown is a browser extension that converts web pages to Markdown files. Your privacy is important to us.

## Data Collection

**Mdown does not collect, store, or transmit any user data.**

- No personal information is collected
- No browsing history is tracked
- No analytics or telemetry is used
- No data is sent to external servers

## How It Works

1. When you click the extension icon, Mdown reads the current page content locally in your browser
2. The content is converted to Markdown format entirely on your device
3. The file is saved directly to your computer or copied to your clipboard

All processing happens locally on your device. No data ever leaves your browser.

## Permissions

- **activeTab**: Access the current page only when you click the extension icon
- **downloads**: Save Markdown files to your device
